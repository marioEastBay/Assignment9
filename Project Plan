Assignment 9 Project Plan


Test cases: 20
We tested the sortDr.cpp file which is the tester for the sorting algortihms.
The program prompts for the file names, to read the file names, and prepares the files. 


Expectations: 
We expect the program to compare the different sorting algorithms and the driver file to time each run. 
The driver file will read from an input file for commands. 
The program prompts for the name of the input file, name of the output file, and the name of the run. 
The program then calls the sorts and displays the results in the output file. 
The driver shows the time it took for each sort to complete. 
We expect the program to run successfully and to display an output file for the sorting algorithms.


Class names: CopyValues, Print, InitValues, BubbleUp2, ShortBubble, Swap, MinIndex, SelectionSort, RadixSort, 
CollectQueues, Split2, QuickSort2, Split, QuickSort, QueType, MakeEmpty, IsFull(), IsEmpty(), Enqueue, 
Dequeue, Merge, MergeSort, InsertItem, InsertionSort, ReheapDown, HeapSort, BubbleUp, and BubbleSort

Functions: while, do-while, for, ifstream, ofstream, dequeue, enqueue, sorting algorithm functions, Nodes

Why one algorithm runs slow or faster than other algorithms
Explain why
